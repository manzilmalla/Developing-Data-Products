This is an app to calculate the compound interest. 

Users can enter the principal amount, adjust the year range, enter the interest amount and at what frequency the interest rates are compounded. The frequency of compounding can be daily, weekly, monthly, semi-yearly or yearly. Users can also pick whether inflation should also be applied.
